Americans know medicine as a symptom treatment model.

Since the baby boomers arrived, we’ve demanded instant gratification for everything from fast food to treating our medical needs.

Now, even millennials have gut absorption issues from the medication we’ve taken over the years.

This type of medicine is great if you just want a band aid so you can get back out and play, but to get real results for chronic conditions where patients often experience pain for months or sometimes years, you must research in places most providers aren’t even aware exist.

enrG IV offers real solutions to problems and even provides for instant gratification in most instances.

Functional medicine gets to the root cause of symptoms and chronic conditions.

Traditional medicine treats the symptoms.

If you go to your traditional provider with a history of chronic headaches, he or she will likely give you a medication to decrease your pain.

A functional medicine provider asks the question “why do you have the headaches?” and will look for the actual cause of the headache, treat the root cause to eliminate the headaches.

The latest diagnostics available have helped patients identify the root cause such as dehydration, food sensitivities, inflammation, and so on.

The goal is to stop your symptoms from occurring.

Functional medicine does not replace traditional medicine; it enhances it by treating the root cause rather than just the symptom.

One of the most valuable of the comprehensive functional therapies available at enrG IV is the intravenous delivery of life enhancing nutrients and natural medicines.
Intravenous (IV) therapies provide relief and healing for people with a wide array of health concerns and objectives including:

•	Compromised immune system
•	Auto immune disorders
•	Athletic performance
•	Cancer / detox from radiation or chemotherapy treatments
•	General detoxification
•	Neurological conditions
•	Asthma
•	Diabetes
•	Fibromyalgia symptoms

why iv therapy works
______________________

	It’s been said “Death begins in the colon”.
	If this is true then bypassing the gut may be the most effective way to health.
	Intravenous delivery allows for fully absorbed nutrients and in most cases the body requires less to heal.
	enrG IV can provide a full list of nutrients that can help heal the digestive system and other systems.

	Auto immune disorders: 
		Allergies and nutritional deficiencies are just a few of the culprits that can suppress the immune system. By intravenously administering high doses of nutrients as well as anti-inflammatory herbs like licorice root we can restore the immune system.

	Athletes:
		Intravenously administered glutamine after a game or training session can speed recovery and restore function to lungs and muscle fibers. In contrast, many athletes are given high doses of Arginine a legally compliant and naturally occurring amino acid that helps the body to produce more growth hormone to prepare for game season.
		Cancer patients: We take a functional approach and work in conjunction with patients that choose chemotherapy and/or radiation to assist with the toxic side effects. We work with patient’s immune system to help with recovery and quality of life.

	Detoxification:
		Patients with heavy metal toxicity and fibromyalgia can benefit from intravenous vitamins and minerals.  Detox is also a great way to kick start a weight loss program.
		Neurological conditions: Patients with neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s can benefit drastically from IV therapies that incorporate glutathione. A major intercellular antioxidant which increases dopamine levels and improves motor function.

	Asthma:
		Magnesium administered intravenously helps reduce the inflammatory effects of asthma to provide long-term relief. A nebulizer with glutathione and other nutrients may be administered to heal the lungs, as IV therapies work at the blood level.

	Diabetes:
		Patients experiencing diabetes-linked neuropathy have had feeling return to limbs and better regulation of insulin with the administration of Alpha Lipoic Acid, a naturally occurring antioxidant.

	Fibromyalgia: 
		Since fibromyalgia symptoms include severe muscle pain, amino acids are administered intravenously. These are the building blocks for our muscle tissue and therefore help muscles recover more quickly, ultimately reducing the aches and pain associated with Fibromyalgia.

		GLUTATHIONE ADD TO ANY IV FOR $
			DETOX, ANTI-AGING
				Glutathione is the “master” antioxidant. It neutralizes free radicals such as superoxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydroxy radicals, peroxynitrites, and hydroperoxides, all of which are byproducts of oxygen metabolism in the mitochondria.
				Free radicals and ROS can cause damage to DNA, proteins and cell membranes altering their function, causing mutations and may be implicated in chronic illnesses like cancer or heart disease. Glutathione renders these molecules inert, protecting you from their destructive effects.
				Detoxification is another major function of glutathione. GSH attaches to substances like heavy metals and xenobiotics—molecules that need to be excreted—forming “conjugates” that make them easier to be eliminated by the liver via bile and the kidneys via urine.
