						<p>Traditional medicine works as a symptom treatment model, providing relief for what is currently bothering us. This approach works very well as a band aid, but it doesn't supply real results for patients with long term ailments, or chronic conditions. enrG IV takes a more functional approach.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="block2">
						<p>
						Functional medicine seeks to discover the root cause of symptoms, and treat it through natural means. It views the body as one integrated system, not a collection of independent organs divided up by medical specialties. This technique results in finding connections and relationships that lead to the core problem. Functional medicine does not replace traditional medicine. It enhances it by eliminating the root cause, stopping the symptoms altogether.</p>

						<p>enrG+ offers real solutions to your health problems and, in most cases, can also provide the instant feeling of relief that you get from traditional medicine. One of the most valuable of our comprehensive functional therapies is the intravenous delivery of life enhancing nutrients and natural medicines. Intravenous (IV) therapies provide relief and healing for people with health concerns of all kinds.</p>
