			<p>Our intravenous vitamin and electrolyte cocktails contain only the purest nutrients. They are designed to help treat everything from sunburns and hangovers, to the flu and other sicknesses.
				Our staff includes medical expert​s​ who have been specially trained in IV Vitamin Therapies, making them fully equipped to provide you with the ultimate drip and drip experience.</p>

			<p>enrG-IV clients undergo brief medical screenings before settling in for their drips (typically between 20 and 60 minute sessions).</p>

			Clients pass the time in recliner chairs, private rooms, at the oxygen bar, in front of flat-screen TVs, and Internet surfing — all while enjoying amenities like signature energy cocktails (made with B-12, as well as amino acids, and enzymes).


			enrG IV offers “classics” like the Myers’ cocktail (magnesium, calcium, B and C vitamins), developed by a Baltimore doctor in the 1970s to treat issues from sinusitis to fibromyalgia.


			Amino acids can be added to stabilize moods and improve energy.
			Vitamin C IV can be infused simultaneously to encourage collagen formation.
