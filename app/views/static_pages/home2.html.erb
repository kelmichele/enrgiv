										<p>IV Nutrient Therapy is the process of administering vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients directly into the bloodstream, intravenously, through an IV drip.
										It is an extremely effective way to deliver nutrients straight to the cells that need them most, allowing you to rehydrate, dispel toxins, and restore balance.</p>

			<p>enrG-IV clients undergo brief medical screenings before settling in for their drips (typically between 20 and 60 minute sessions).</p>

			Clients pass the time in recliner chairs, private rooms, at the oxygen bar, in front of flat-screen TVs, and Internet surfing — all while enjoying amenities like signature energy cocktails (made with B-12, as well as amino acids, and enzymes).


			enrG IV offers “classics” like the Myers’ cocktail (magnesium, calcium, B and C vitamins), developed by a Baltimore doctor in the 1970s to treat issues from sinusitis to fibromyalgia.


			Amino acids can be added to stabilize moods and improve energy.
			Vitamin C IV can be infused simultaneously to encourage collagen formation.
