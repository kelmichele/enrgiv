							<h4>What is IV Vitamin Therapy?</h4>
							<div class="title-line"></div><div class="clearfix"></div>
							<p>Intravenous (IV) Vitamin Therapy is the process of administering vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients directly into the bloodstream through an IV drip. It bypasses the digestive system, and delivers the nutrients promptly to the cells where they are needed.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="block2">
							<h4>Why Does it Work?</h4>
							<div class="title-line"></div><div class="clearfix"></div>
							<p>Because it skips digestion, intravenous delivery allows nutrients to be completely absorbed, and in most cases, the body requires less to heal. It results in faster, longer lasting relief, as the nutrients work to rehydrate, dispel toxins, and restore balance.</p>

								<div class="cbp-caption-activeWrap">
									<div class="cbp-l-caption-body">
										<p>Allergies and nutritional deficiencies are just a few of the culprits that can suppress the immune system. By intravenously administering high doses of nutrients as well as anti-inflammatory herbs like licorice root we can restore the immune system.</p>

								<div class="cbp-caption-defaultWrap"><h4>Athletes</h4></div>
								<div class="cbp-caption-activeWrap">
									<div class="cbp-l-caption-body">
										<p>Intravenously administered glutamine after a game or training session can speed recovery and restore function to lungs and muscle fibers. In contrast, many athletes are given high doses of Arginine a legally compliant and naturally occurring amino acid that helps the body to produce more growth hormone to prepare for game season.</p>
